Some specimen have labels that are not present in the image itself but GPT4 tries to allocate an appropriate label for the text that it extracts in the json format. This is interesting to note and we will be working on creating uniform labels for every specimen after discussion with the Clients and Professor. There are still inaccuracies in the extracted handwritten texts but we will be able to confirm the accuracy measure only after the subject matter experts go through the results folder. There are also additional comments provided by the model to more accurately assess the text extraction with caution warnings that certain phrases it extracts are from handwritten samples and may not be the best match. Overall promising results found for all the specimen. Folder with extracted text is named **gpt4v-results**\n",

    "2. **GBIF Evaluation set** : This smaller specimen set was formed to compare results obtained by GPT4-V and Azure Vision. Azure vision cannot handle images of higher size and resolution so we manually extracted specimen (with both plant+label and only label) from the GBIF database to run through both the LLMs. Observations were not as good for GPT4-V, since it could not understand the request we gave it for most of the specimen and was only able to extract text for a few of them. We are experimenting with this a bit more, since it could be an effect of the lower quality images used in this case or an API request issue from their end. Updates on the Azure Vision part are present in the Azure OCR notebook. Folder with extracted text is named **gpt4v-results-gbif**"
