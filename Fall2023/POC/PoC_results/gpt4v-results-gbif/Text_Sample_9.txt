Certainly! Here's the text from the image in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Country": "BRAZIL",
  "State": "SÃ£o Paulo",
  "City": "Varzea",
  "Date": "19 January 1941",
  "Signature": "M. Carretero"
}
```

It should be noted that the readability of the handwritten text may vary and my interpretation of the signature may not be entirely accurate.
