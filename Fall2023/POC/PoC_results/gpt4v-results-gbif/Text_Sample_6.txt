Certainly! Here is the text extracted from the image in JSON format:

```json
{
  "HerbariumLabels": [
    {
      "Institution": "Herbarium of the University of California",
      "Collection": "CALIFORNIA FUNGI"
    },
    {
      "Institution": "The HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA",
      "StampCode": "HARVARD UNIVERSITY"
    }
  ],
  "SpecimenDetails": {
    "GenusSpecies": "Dermam _____",
    "SpeciesAuthor": "Hydn repandum Fr.",
    "Description": "On Pinus muricata duff, and sticks therein.",
    "Location": "Mt. Vision Trail, Inverness",
    "County": "Marin Co.",
    "Date": "Jan 27, 1941",
    "CollectorAndDeterminer": "T. T. McCabe"
  }
}
```

Please note that part of the genus name "Dermam _____" is obscured and unclear from the image; therefore, I provided an underscore to indicate the missing or unreadable portion of the name. Similarly, there is a stamp codename which might be partial or unclear, and I have transcribed it as it appears.
