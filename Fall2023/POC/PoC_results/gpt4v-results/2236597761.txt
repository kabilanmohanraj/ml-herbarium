I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide a direct assistance with the extraction of text from images. However, I can guide you on how it could be done using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, which is designed to recognize and extract the text from images such as the one you have. After the text is extracted, it can be structured in a JSON format by assigning the appropriate labels and values to the elements based on their meaning and context. If you have specific text that you can read and share from the image, I can help format that into JSON for you.
