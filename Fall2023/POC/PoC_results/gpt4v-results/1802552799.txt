Please note that the scientific name was previously written as "Nierembergia asplundii (P. Taylor)" and later seems to have been corrected or updated to "Utricularia asplundii P. Taylor". Photographs of herbarium sheets often contain handwriting and annotations that reflect taxonomic updates or revisions.
