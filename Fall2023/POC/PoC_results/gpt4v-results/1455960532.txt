Please note that the format of JSON provided is based on the text visible in the image, and the keys have been created based on the context of the text. Some of the content, such as handwritten text or obscured text, cannot be determined from this angle, such as collection numbers at the bottom or specific annotations on the envelope that's covering part of the label. If there is additional text that is not visible, it cannot be transcribed.
