Sure, I can help with that. Here's the extracted text from the image in JSON format:

```json
{
  "Specimen_Label": {
    "Specimen_Id": "W 119219",
    "Herbarium": "Herbarium of New England Botanical Club",
    "Species_Name": "Agrostis stolonifera",
    "Collection_Location": "Fremont, New Hampshire (Rockingham County)",
    "Collection_Date": "July 19, 1927",
    "Collector": "C.P. Weatherby",
    "Additional_Notes": "Open moist ground",
    "Stamp": "COLLECTED FOR THE NEW ENGLAND BOTANICAL CLUB"
  },
  "Herbarium_Stamp": {
    "Text": "NEW ENGLAND BOTANICAL CLUB",
    "Date": "MAR 19 1938"
  },
  "Barcode": "http://www.barcode.com/119219"
}
```

Note: The URL in the "Barcode" field is a placeholder since the barcode is not resolvable from the image and does not have an actual URL encoded in it. The actual barcode provides a unique identifier which typically links to a database entry for the specimen.
